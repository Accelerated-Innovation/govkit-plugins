Rapid Validation (AIPOS Pillar 2): test the riskiest assumptions *before* committing
production engineering capacity. One skill, seven validation artifacts, one primary output —
the **Validation Decision**: go, no-go, or revise.

## What it does

The `val-rapid-validation` skill helps a Product Manager build the evidence that answers
Pillar 2's core question — *can this solution create useful, safe, measurable value before we
invest in full production buildout?* — at the cheapest point in the lifecycle, where testing
an assumption costs days instead of sprints.

The artifact menu is organised by the three questions the Validation Decision must answer:

| Question | Artifacts |
|---|---|
| Is the problem real and worth solving? | Interview guide · Problem sizing |
| Will the solution actually solve it? | Visual prototype brief · Demand test · GenAI eval stub & brief |
| Is it feasible and economic? | Feasibility spike |
| Make the call | Viability brief (carries the Validation Decision) |

Every artifact carries a hypothesis, an experiment, and a decision rule — what the PM will do
differently depending on the result. Every claim is provenance-marked: `[E]` evidence-backed,
`[I]` inferred, `[A]` assumption. The skill never invents evidence, personas, metrics, or
quotes; a missing number becomes a marked assumption, never a plausible-looking figure.

What it does **not** do: it is Build-to-**Learn**, deliberately ungoverned relative to
delivery. It emits no Gherkin, no NFRs, no evaluation schemas, no build-ready specifications —
those are born *at* the Validation Decision, in Build-to-Earn territory (see the companion
`govkit` plugin, which picks up exactly there). It also never writes to a system of record
without a previewed, explicit yes.

### When to use it

- "Is this worth building?" / "we need to validate before we commit"
- "How do we know people actually want this?"
- "Size this opportunity" / "leadership wants to know if it's big enough"
- "Can we actually build this?" / "does the data even exist?"
- "It's a GenAI feature and 'good' is fuzzy — what would prove it works?"
- "We've done the discovery work — should we kill this or build it?"
- "Prep me for user interviews"

**When not to use it:** once the Validation Decision is *go* and you need acceptance
criteria, NFRs, or a readiness gate — that is `govkit`, not this plugin.

## Installation

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add Accelerated-Innovation/govkit-plugins   # once per machine
claude plugin install aipos-p2@aipos
```

### Prerequisites

None required — the skill is plain markdown with no scripts or packages. Optional: an Aha!
MCP connector, used only for evidence intake from a record and for the prompted write-back of
finished artifacts. Everything also works from pasted material or from nothing but a hunch.

## Usage

Describe your situation or name an artifact; the skill opens with the artifact menu and
routes you. It asks one primary question at a time, reads whatever evidence you give it
before asking for facts, and defaults forward on "proceed" / "looks good". Each finished
artifact is delivered as a file, states which of the three questions it moves and what
remains unevidenced, prompts (never assumes) a save to the record, and names the next
artifact — validation is a sequence, not a menu visit.

## Examples

### Example: Route a hunch to the right artifact

- **Prompt:** `We have a hunch that our support agents waste a lot of time searching old tickets for similar cases, but we have no data. How should we validate this before committing engineering?`
- **Expected:** The validation artifact menu, with a routed recommendation to start at the
  "is the problem real?" question (interview guide, then problem sizing), a stated
  hypothesis for the first artifact, and one primary question back to the PM — no invented
  metrics, personas, or quotes anywhere.
- **Safe to auto-run:** yes
- **Inputs:** none.

### Example: Size a problem from pasted evidence

- **Prompt:** `Build a problem sizing from this: we have 40 support agents; a shadowing session with 6 of them measured 35-50 minutes per agent per day spent searching old tickets; loaded cost is about $38/hour. Assume nothing else.`
- **Expected:** A problem-sizing artifact written to a file, with the measured inputs marked
  `[E]`, every extrapolation marked `[I]` or `[A]`, a sensitivity pass on the assumptions, a
  decision rule stating what result would justify proceeding — followed by a prompt (not an
  action) to save it to the record and a pointer to the next artifact.
- **Safe to auto-run:** no
- **Inputs:** none beyond the inline figures; writes the artifact file to the working
  directory.

### Example: Make the call with a viability brief

- **Prompt:** `We've finished the interviews, sizing, demand test, and feasibility spike for the ticket-search assistant. Build the viability brief and help me make the go / no-go / revise call.`
- **Expected:** A viability brief that synthesises the existing evidence with provenance
  marks, answers the three validation questions, carries an explicit go / no-go / revise
  Validation Decision with its rationale, and *names* (without writing) the handoff inputs
  Build-to-Earn will need — problem statement, MVP scope, evaluation criteria, guardrail
  requirements. Ends with the prompted record write-back offer.
- **Safe to auto-run:** no
- **Inputs:** the prior artifacts (pasted, attached, or on an Aha! record); writes the brief
  to a file.

## Limits and gotchas

- **It will refuse to write specs.** Asking for Gherkin or NFRs here gets a polite redirect:
  specs are born at the Validation Decision, not before it. Use `govkit` after a *go*.
- **Missing evidence stays missing.** The skill would rather ship an artifact full of `[A]`
  marks with a sensitivity analysis than one plausible fabricated baseline.
- **Write-back requires a fresh, explicit yes every time** — an earlier "sounds good" is
  never standing approval. It also cannot create Aha! attachments itself; it hands that step
  to the PM by filename.
- The artifacts are working documents written as files, not just chat output — expect files
  in your working directory.
- A demand test without a sized problem produces a number nobody can interpret; the skill
  will build what you ask for, but it says once what's missing and why it weakens the result.
