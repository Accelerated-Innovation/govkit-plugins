# Record write-back

Every artifact ends with an offer to put it on the tracker record. This exists because the
artifact's job is not to be read once in a chat window — it is to be findable six weeks later
by someone who wasn't in the conversation.

**Prompt every time. Write only on an explicit yes.** Never write to a system of record
unprompted, and never treat a general "sounds good" earlier in the session as standing
approval for a later write.

## The three pieces

Offer all three in one prompt, naming which apply. Most artifacts warrant all three; some
warrant two.

### 1. Attachment — the artifact itself

**This is the important one.** The full file, attached to the record. A comment describes an
artifact; an attachment *is* the artifact. An interview guide whose questions live only in
the PM's downloads folder cannot be run by the person taking session 4, which defeats the
point of writing it.

**Constraint you must state plainly: you cannot create attachments.** The Aha! connector can
read attachments but has no upload tool. So the offer is a named handoff, not a claim:

> "Attach `opp2-interview-guide.md` to OPP-2 — I can't upload files to the record myself."

Give the exact filename. "Attach the file" gets forgotten; a named file gets done.

**Fallback when nobody will upload:** post the full artifact as a second comment. It is ugly
and it will be long, but an ugly complete record beats a tidy incomplete one. Offer this
explicitly rather than letting the artifact quietly fail to land.

### 2. Comment — the index

A summary comment that lets someone scanning the activity feed understand what exists and
what it concluded, without opening anything. It should carry:

- the artifact name, its number, and the date
- the hypothesis or the question it was built to answer
- the decision rule or verdict
- the evidence-base line — especially when the honest version is unflattering
- what it does **not** retire
- anything that must be corrected before the artifact is used
- the next artifact

Keep it an index, not a duplicate of the file. If the comment and the attachment say the same
thing at the same length, the comment is wasted.

### 3. To-do — only when there is a named next action

**Do not create a to-do by default.** A to-do that isn't a specific action with an owner
trains people to ignore the queue, and then the ones that matter get ignored too.

The test: *does this artifact end with someone needing to do something specific?*

| Artifact | To-do? | The action |
|---|---|---|
| 1 Interview guide | Yes | Run n sessions by a date |
| 2 Problem sizing | Yes | Go measure the inputs that dominate the result |
| 3 Visual prototype | Yes | Run it in the sessions; attach the session logs after |
| 4 Demand test | Yes | Launch the test, with the stop date |
| 5 Feasibility spike | Yes | The spike itself, timeboxed |
| 6 Eval stub & brief | Usually not | It is a definition others consume |
| 7 Viability brief | No | It *is* the decision — a to-do here is a decision nobody made |

Write the to-do body as the actions themselves, ordered by how much each moves the result,
not as a description of the artifact.

## Naming

These get re-run. Three sizings six months apart are indistinguishable on a record unless the
filenames say otherwise.

```
<record>-<artifact>.md          e.g. opp2-problem-sizing.md
<record>-<artifact>-<date>.md   when a re-run supersedes an earlier version
```

Date every comment in its first line. When an artifact supersedes an earlier one, say so in
the comment and name what changed — a record with two sizings and no indication of which is
current is worse than a record with one.

## Prototypes specifically

A prototype is three files, and all three belong on the record:

1. the **brief** — what is under test and how it will be judged
2. the **prototype itself** — the HTML, so anyone can open it
3. the **session logs** — after each round, exported from the observer panel

The brief without the prototype is a plan nobody ran. The prototype without the brief is a
demo, and six weeks later nobody remembers which cases were planted or what would have
counted as failure. Attach them together, always.
