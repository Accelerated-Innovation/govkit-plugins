"""Check a Solution Framing canvas and compute every number the canvas displays.

The canvas is a shareable one-page artifact, so its numbers get quoted. This script is the
reason they can be: nothing on the rendered canvas is typed by hand if it can be derived.
Percent changes, derived targets, per-unit savings, impact at scale, evidence counts, date
ranges and aging are computed here from the canvas's own inputs and the graph read it records;
a stated figure that disagrees with the computed one is an error, not a style note.

It also enforces the provenance contract (references/canvas-schema.md):

  * every content position holds a field of the right kind — facts where the world is
    described, decisions where the PM authors — so nothing escapes the checks by its shape
  * facts carry a provenance mark; an `[E]` fact cites references the graph returned; on an
    engine-sourced canvas an `[I]` fact's basis is graph references, not a note
  * a missing fact is an evidence GAP, wired through the canvas: a to-do that gathers it, a
    panel-5 assumption that names it, and a panel-6 plan item that retires it
  * Proceed is available only when the primary metric's baseline is graph-backed
  * quotes and current-state examples are verbatim graph excerpts the PM approved

It reports; it never crashes. Malformed input becomes a MALFORMED or type error.

Usage:
  verify_canvas.py canvas.json            # report only (JSON to stdout); exit 1 on errors
  verify_canvas.py canvas.json --write    # also write the `computed` block back into the file

Standard library only.
