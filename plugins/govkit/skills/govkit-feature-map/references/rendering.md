# Rendering the map

`scripts/render_map.py` builds one self-contained HTML file — inline CSS and JS, no network calls, no build step. It gets emailed, pasted into a wiki, and opened offline six months later, so it has to keep working with nothing around it.

```bash
python scripts/render_map.py -f features.json -s scores.json -c config.json -o feature-map.html
```

`-s` and `-c` are optional. Without scores the map still renders — chain, cards, ledger — just without badges.

## config.json

```jsonc
{
  "title": "AI Vision Builder — Feature Map",
  "eyebrow": "Epic AI-123 · Initiative KTW_AIOS",
  "motto": "Visuals orient · specs authorise · Jira reports status.",
  "lede": "How the chain was derived, which labels drive it, what is excluded.",

  "central": ["AI-201", "AI-202"],     // rendered in the 'central' border colour
  "undecided": ["AI-207"],             // dashed amber — an unresolved boundary
  "centralLabel": "Runs centrally",
  "deploymentLabel": "Runs in the client VPC",

  "lanes": [
    {"name": "Experience", "sub": "what the client touches",
     "note": "Client-visible surface. Every question here must earn its place."}
  ],

  "positions": {"AI-201": [40, 84], "AI-202": [390, 136]}
}
```

`lanes` controls order and adds framing text; `name` must match the features' `workstream`. Omit it and lanes are inferred in first-seen order with no framing.

`central` / `undecided` express whatever boundary matters in the architecture — deployment topology, team ownership, trust zone. The two colours plus a dashed state are deliberately few; a diagram that encodes five distinctions in border style stops being readable.

Put the derivation in `lede`. A reader needs to know the chain is *derived* from label conventions rather than drawn by hand, or they will treat a missing edge as an architectural claim rather than a missing label.

## Hand-placing the chain

Auto-layout places nodes by dependency depth — column is depth, row is a barycentre pass over producers to reduce crossings. It is honest and fast, and fine for a working session.

It is not as good as a person. For anything going in front of stakeholders, set `positions` explicitly: `{"KEY": [x, y]}`, nodes are 200×84, and 350×140 spacing reads well. Hand placement lets you group by phase, put the boundary crossing in the middle, and keep related features adjacent — none of which an algorithm infers from a DAG.

Long chains render wide and the container scrolls horizontally. That is deliberate: scaling a nine-column chain down to page width makes every label unreadable, which defeats the diagram. If the width is genuinely unwieldy, hand-place into a serpentine.

## Visual grammar

**Development Token ribbon** across the top of each card, colour-coded, with the score. Green Approved, amber Approved with edits, red Blocked.

**Score pill** on each chain node, same colours. This is the piece that makes readiness spatial — a reader sees *where* in the flow the weakness sits.

**GovKit readiness panel** inside each card: summary, critical blockers, ranked edits, and the ten-dimension breakdown with a coloured pip per dimension. Collapsed by default so the card stays scannable, but present so the badge is auditable in place. A badge nobody can interrogate gets ignored the first time somebody disagrees with it.

**The standing caveat** renders above the chain whenever scores are present, stating that the blocker list is the gate rather than the number, and that these are batch scores. Do not remove it. Someone will read this page without the conversation that produced it.

## Verifying the render

Screenshot and look at it. Then assert the things eyes miss:

```javascript
const {chromium} = require('playwright');
(async () => {
  const b = await chromium.launch({executablePath: '/opt/pw-browsers/chromium'})
    .catch(() => chromium.launch());
  const p = await b.newPage({viewport: {width: 1700, height: 1250}, deviceScaleFactor: 1.3});
  await p.goto('file://' + process.cwd() + '/feature-map.html', {waitUntil: 'load'});
  await p.screenshot({path: 'check.png'});

  console.log(JSON.stringify(await p.evaluate(() => ({
    cards:  document.querySelectorAll('article.card').length,
    tokens: document.querySelectorAll('.card .token').length,
    pills:  document.querySelectorAll('svg .tkbg').length,
    dims:   document.querySelectorAll('table.dim tr').length,   // 10 per scored feature
    // node rects must not overlap; exclude the pill rects nested inside each node
    overlap: (() => {
      const r = [...document.querySelectorAll('svg .node rect:not(.tkbg)')]
        .map(n => n.getBoundingClientRect());
      let c = 0;
      for (let i = 0; i < r.length; i++)
        for (let j = i + 1; j < r.length; j++)
          if (!(r[i].right < r[j].left || r[j].right < r[i].left ||
                r[i].bottom < r[j].top || r[j].bottom < r[i].top)) c++;
      return c;
    })()
  }))));

  // mobile
  const m = await b.newPage({viewport: {width: 390, height: 844}, deviceScaleFactor: 2});
  await m.goto('file://' + process.cwd() + '/feature-map.html', {waitUntil: 'load'});
  await m.screenshot({path: 'check-mobile.png'});
  await b.close();
})();
```

`tokens` and `pills` should equal the scored-feature count, `dims` should be exactly ten times it, and `overlap` must be `0`. A mismatch between token count and score count means a feature key in `scores.json` does not match any key in `features.json` — the renderer warns about this on stdout too.

## Delivering

Send the HTML with `SendUserFile`. A feature map is something a team comes back to and re-reads, so when a desktop is connected also persist it with `create_artifact` so it survives outside the conversation; use `update_artifact` on later rebuilds rather than creating a second copy.

Keep `features.json`, `scores.json` and `config.json` alongside the output. Re-running the map after a spec changes should mean re-ingesting and re-scoring, not rebuilding the inputs by hand.
