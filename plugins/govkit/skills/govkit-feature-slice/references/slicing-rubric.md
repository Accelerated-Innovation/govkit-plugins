## Purpose

Two judgments per scenario, kept deliberately separate:

1. **Size** — how big the scenario is, judged from the underlying architecture it touches, not from its line count.
2. **Slice** — which release it belongs to, judged from what the feature needs to fundamentally function.

Size never decides slice. A tiny nice-to-have stays `@v2`; a Large must-have stays `@mvp` — and that combination is precisely the risk the rubric exists to surface.

## Step 1 — the Scenario Complexity Matrix

Score each scenario on three dimensions, **integers 1–3 only**:

| Dimension | Low (1 point) | Medium (2 points) | High (3 points) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Data & State** | Uses static data; no special session state required. | Requires specific database states or pre-existing accounts. | Third-party data dependencies or complex state transitions. |
| **Integration** | Isolated to a single system component or service. | Integrates two internal systems (e.g., frontend to internal API). | Connects to external vendor APIs, payment gateways, or legacy systems. |
| **UI/UX Steps** | Standard form inputs, simple button clicks, or static redirects. | Dynamic elements, multi-step modals, or conditional UI rendering. | Complex charts, drag-and-drop interfaces, or real-time updates. |

Judging guidance per dimension:

**Data & State** — read the `Given` steps. What must exist before this scenario can run? Static or no preconditions score 1. A precondition naming a specific record, account, or prior state scores 2. Data owned by a third party, or a `Given` describing a multi-step state machine ("an order that has been paid, partially shipped, and disputed"), scores 3.

**Integration** — count the systems the scenario's `When`/`Then` traverse. One component, 1. Two internal systems talking, 2. Anything crossing the organization's boundary — vendor API, payment gateway, legacy system with its own release cycle — 3. External systems score high because their failure modes, auth, and rate limits are not under the team's control.

**UI/UX Steps** — judge the interaction surface's mechanics, not its visual polish. For non-UI features (APIs, batch jobs, CLIs), score the interface analogously: a simple request/response is 1, a multi-step or stateful protocol is 2, streaming/real-time or long-running orchestration is 3.

Scoring rules:

- Judge from the scenario's own text plus the feature's stated context. Never assume an integration or state the spec does not mention.
- Write a note per dimension grounded in the text ("Given references a pre-existing locked account → 2").
- If a dimension is genuinely unknowable from the spec, score what the text supports and record the uncertainty in the note. An unknowable dimension is a spec gap — report it; do not inflate the score to be safe.
- **Never total the points yourself.** `scripts/compute_size.py` computes sums, bands, and rollups. The judgments are yours; the arithmetic is not.

## Size bands

| Band | Points | Reading |
|---|---|---|
| **Small** | 3–4 | Quick to build; automates easily. |
| **Medium** | 5–7 | Standard user flow; average development effort. |
| **Large** | 8–9 | High risk; consider slicing this individual scenario down further. |

A Large band is an instruction, not just a label: propose a split (patterns below) or make the PM accept the risk explicitly.

## Step 2 — MoSCoW release slicing

Map each scenario to a release slice using MoSCoW matched against its Gherkin structure.

**The MVP test is strict:** *can the feature fundamentally function without this scenario?* If yes, it is not `@mvp`. Most scenarios fail this test; a thin MVP is the point.

| Slice | MoSCoW | Contains | Gherkin indicators | Example (login feature) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `@mvp` | Must-have | The critical path only — scenarios without which the feature cannot fundamentally function. | The simplest positive happy path. Usually zero error handling, standard default settings, primary user persona. | Authenticating with a basic username and password. |
| `@v1` | Should-have | Vital operational stability, security, and the most common alternative paths. | Common error pathways, critical validation rules (e.g., password strength), primary data variations (often a `Scenario Outline`). | Resetting a forgotten password, locked-account handling, basic form validation. |
| `@v2` | Could-have / nice-to-have | Optimization, advanced UX, edge cases, and secondary personas. V2 *or later*. | Complex third-party integrations, edge-case rules, performance-heavy scenarios, nice-to-have UI enhancements. | Biometric FaceID login, social SSO, "Remember Me" session persistence. |

Slicing guidance:

- **Compliance can promote a scenario.** The table puts security and error handling in `@v1`, but a scenario backed by a compliance, privacy, or safety NFR may be unshippable-without — in some organizations a login feature cannot go live without lockout. When an NFR or a privacy note implies promotion, flag it and let the PM make the call. Release intent is theirs.
- **`Scenario Outline` rows can split across slices.** If the happy row is critical path and the edge rows are not, recommend splitting the outline rather than dragging the whole table into `@mvp`.
- **Untagged is a valid state.** A scenario the PM has not decided on stays untagged; do not default it into a slice to make the table look finished.

## Size × slice: the risk view

The two judgments compose into the numbers a release conversation actually runs on:

- **Per-slice points** — "the MVP is 12 points, V1 adds 18" is the roadmap sentence this rubric exists to produce.
- **Large + `@mvp`** — the highest-risk combination: the smallest shippable version contains the riskiest work. Every such scenario gets either a split proposal or an explicit, recorded risk acceptance. Never let one pass silently.
- **The feature rollup** — band counts plus total, e.g. `2L / 5M / 3S · 41 pts`. Counts, not an average: ten Medium scenarios and a feature hiding two Large ones can average the same, and the two Large ones are the finding.

## Splitting oversized scenarios

Patterns for taking an 8–9 point scenario apart. After any split, re-size each piece; a split whose pieces are still Large has not split the risk, only the text.

| Pattern | When | How |
|---|---|---|
| **Split by rule** | The scenario proves two business rules at once. | One scenario per rule; each keeps its own observable outcome. |
| **Split by variation** | A `Scenario Outline` mixes the critical row with edge rows. | Happy row becomes a plain `@mvp` scenario; edge rows stay an outline in a later slice. |
| **Split by state** | A heavy `Given` sets up a complex prior state. | One scenario establishes and proves the state transition; a second consumes it with a thin `Given`. |
| **Split by integration boundary** | The critical path routes through a third party. | An `@mvp` scenario proves the behavior against a stubbed boundary; a later-slice scenario proves the live integration. State the stub in the `Given` so the scenario stays honest. |
| **Reduce interaction ambition** | The UI/UX dimension alone drives the score. | A static or simplified interaction in `@mvp`; the dynamic/real-time version as its own `@v2` scenario. |

Splitting restructures scenarios; it never changes what they promise. If a split would alter product intent, that is a refinement conversation (`govkit-feature-refine`), not a slicing edit.

## Tag vocabulary

| Tag | Meaning | Set by |
|---|---|---|
| `@mvp` `@v1` `@v2` | Release slice (`@v2` = V2 or later) | The PM's confirmed decision — never applied unconfirmed |
| `@small` `@medium` `@large` | Size band | Derived from `compute_size.py` output; regenerate on every re-size |

Rules:

- Tags go on the line above the `Scenario` / `Scenario Outline` keyword, slice tag first: `@mvp @small`.
- Exactly one slice tag and at most one size tag per scenario. Untagged means undecided, not `@v2`.
- Numeric points live in the sizing JSON, never in tags — bands are stable under small re-judgments, points are not, and CI filters (`--tags @mvp`) want stable names.
- Preserve any tag this skill does not own (`@wip`, `@smoke`, team conventions) exactly as found.
- These are standard Cucumber tags: a team can run `cucumber --tags @mvp` and execute exactly the MVP slice. That is a feature, not a coincidence — the tags survive the tracker→repo handoff and every downstream skill and CI step can read them.

## What size is not

- **Not story points.** Complexity points measure architectural surface, not effort or velocity. Do not feed them into sprint capacity math.
- **Not a quality judgment.** Quality is `govkit-feature-refine`'s rubric. A beautifully written scenario can be Large; a sloppy one can be Small. A feature can score 9/10 on quality and still carry three Large scenarios — those are different findings, and both matter.
- **Not a verdict on the team.** Size describes the work, not the people. A portfolio where everything is Large is a slicing opportunity, not an indictment.
