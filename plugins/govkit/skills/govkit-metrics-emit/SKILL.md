  Emit structured Tier 1 metric events (NDJSON) from a GovKit-governed repository's
  exhaust — feature packages, .govkit/marker.json, eval_criteria.yaml, CI gate runs,
  PR exports, and git history. Use this skill whenever the user wants to compute,
  emit, export, or audit delivery/quality metrics from a GovKit repo: spec
  completeness scores, gate-readiness audits, metric event streams for an
  aggregator, velocity/quality pair inputs, or "which features aren't gate-ready."
  Trigger on mentions of GovKit metrics, metric events, telemetry emission,
  feature package audit, spec completeness, or AIPOS Tier 1 metrics — even if the
  user doesn't name this skill.

# govkit-metrics-emit

Producer side of the AIPOS federated metrics topology. Reads GovKit artifacts and
emits **org-agnostic** structured metric events as NDJSON. Aggregation (baselines,
targets, benchmarks, trends) happens elsewhere — never here.

## The one law that governs everything here

**Producers stay org-agnostic.** Events must contain only repo-relative facts:
feature IDs, file names, scores, timestamps, commit SHAs, gate names. Never emit
organization names, employee names/emails beyond what git history inherently
carries, internal URLs, ticket-system references, targets, or baselines. Those
belong to the aggregator. If the user asks to add org context to events, explain
the federated split and offer to put it in an aggregator-side enrichment note
instead.

## How to run

Everything is done by the bundled script — do not hand-roll parsers:

```bash
python scripts/emit_metrics.py <repo_path> \
  [--ci-runs <ci_runs.json>] \
  [--prs <prs.json>] \
  [--rework-days 21] \
  [--out events.ndjson] \
  [--validate]
```

- `<repo_path>`: root of a GovKit-governed repo (has `features/` and ideally `.govkit/marker.json`).
- `--ci-runs`: optional JSON export of CI workflow runs (`gh run list --json name,conclusion,createdAt,updatedAt,headSha,attempt,displayTitle,headBranch` or an Azure equivalent list). Produces `gate.run.completed` events.
- `--prs`: optional JSON export of merged PRs (`gh pr list --state merged --json number,title,createdAt,mergedAt,additions,deletions,changedFiles,reviews,commits,headRefName`). Produces `pr.merged` events.
- `--rework-days`: window for the rework scan (default 21, per catalog).
- `--validate`: after emitting, check every event against the vocabulary and print a validation summary (event counts, unknown fields, pairing coverage).

Without any optional inputs the script still emits `feature.package.snapshot`
(one per feature, from the working tree + git history) and `rework.observed`
(from git history alone). That is the minimum useful run.

## Event vocabulary (catalog v1)

Five events: `feature.package.snapshot`, `pr.merged`, `gate.run.completed`,
`deploy.completed`, `rework.observed`. Full field definitions, the spec
completeness rubric (0–100, seven components), and which Tier 1 metric pair each
event feeds are in `references/event_schema.md` — read it when the user asks what
a field means, questions a score, or wants to map events to metrics.

`deploy.completed` is defined in the vocabulary but this producer does not emit
it (deployment events originate in CI/CD, not in GovKit artifacts). Say so if
asked, and point to the CI-side adapter as the emitter.

## Interpreting results for the user

- **Spec completeness score** is the leading quality counterweight (Pair 4).
  100 = gate-ready. When reporting it, always show the per-component breakdown
  from `completeness.components` — the number alone hides *what's* missing.
- A feature with `thresholds_met: false` or null FIRST/Virtue scores is not a
  parsing problem; it's an author who hasn't finished the Evaluation Compliance
  Summary in `plan.md`. Report it that way.
- **Rework** uses a file-overlap approximation (documented in the reference).
  Present it as an upper bound and say so; exact line provenance is the
  aggregator's v2 job.
- Never present a velocity number without its quality counterweight (paired-metric
  law). If the user asks for "just throughput," give the pair and explain briefly.

## Common tasks

**"Which features aren't gate-ready?"** — run the script, filter snapshots where
`completeness.score < 100`, and present a table: feature, score, missing
components (from the breakdown), plus the emitted events file path.

**"Generate events for the aggregator"** — run with all available inputs and
`--validate`, save NDJSON, report event counts per type and the validation
summary.

**"Is this output safe to share outside the org?"** — run `--validate`, then
grep the NDJSON for anything org-identifying; the only identity-adjacent content
should be git author fields inside standard git metadata. Report findings.
